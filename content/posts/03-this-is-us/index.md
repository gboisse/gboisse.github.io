<div style="text-align: justify">

after wrapping our previous production, i started thinking about what we could do next.
i really wanted to move towards path traced lighting as this has always been a fascination of mine.
furthermore, our previous production was fairly static, moving from one mostly non-moving scene to the next, so i wanted to give this one some more motion and more abstract effects.

all in all, i set up on the following "effects" that i wanted our production to showcase, hopefully wrapped up in some story of sort:
- path tracing
- volumetric shadowing
- fluid simulation

i'll go over these in this post and hope you can take something out of these experiments:)
